Explore the structure of the downloaded Bootstrap directory
When you download Bootstrap (compiled version) from the official Bootstrap website, you'll get a folder with the following structure:

📁 Bootstrap Folder Structure:
arduino
Copy code
bootstrap/
├── css/
│   ├── bootstrap.css
│   ├── bootstrap.min.css
│   └── bootstrap.min.css.map
│
├── js/
│   ├── bootstrap.bundle.js
│   ├── bootstrap.bundle.min.js
│   ├── bootstrap.js
│   └── bootstrap.min.js

└── icons/  (only if downloaded separately from https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)
🗂️ Folder Purposes:
1. css/ folder:
Contains all compiled Bootstrap stylesheets.

bootstrap.min.css – Minified version for production (smaller size).

bootstrap.css – Full version with spacing and comments for development.

.map files help browsers map minified code back to the original source when debugging.

2. js/ folder:
Contains Bootstrap JavaScript files.

bootstrap.bundle.min.js – Includes Bootstrap’s JavaScript plugins + Popper.js (required for tooltips, dropdowns, modals).

bootstrap.min.js – Only Bootstrap plugins (Popper must be included separately).

✅ Use bootstrap.bundle.min.js if you want everything to work (recommended).

3. icons/ folder:
Not included in the main download.

Must be downloaded from Bootstrap Icons.

It contains SVG icons that can be used with Bootstrap components.
